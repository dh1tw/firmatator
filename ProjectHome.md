Firmatator is a computer-side C++/Qt library implementation of the Firmata protocol. It basically allows you to directly set/read the status of a microcontroller (arduino) board directly in your C++ code.

Current features include:

> - Read / Write of digital inputs / outputs
> - Read / Write of analog inputs / outputs (PWM)
> - Control of servomotors
> - I2C protocol (not tested)
